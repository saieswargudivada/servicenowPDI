MVP 1:
When a complex issue arises, the Problem Owner (PO) initiates a Problem Record using the Virtual Agent/Chat Bot functionality within ServiceNow. 

Future MVPs:
From there, the PO can seamlessly schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting directly within ServiceNow, or alternatively, via an integrated chatbot interface.
During the meeting, transcription is enabled through the Microsoft Teams Transcription API. ServiceNow captures the transcription data and forwards it to Ask AT&T. Leveraging advanced AI capabilities, Ask AT&T transforms the raw transcription into well-structured Agile Stories, including concise short descriptions and detailed narratives.
These Agile Stories, along with their associated tasks, are automatically created and linked back to the original Problem Record. This streamlined process enhances issue resolution by ensuring all action items are clearly documented, tracked, and managed within a unified system.
